#Â Controllers

Controllers handle output and input.

- Output: how the data coming from models is transformed for sending to views (for HTML pages), or transformed directly into an RSS feed, JSON feed, etc.
- Input: how data sent from the browser to the server is processed - either by generating a page response, or accepting POST data from a form (and then also generating a page response).
