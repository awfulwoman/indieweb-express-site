# Models

Models handle how data is stored and retrieved in the app. In our case data is mostly stored as human-readable Markdown files. 

There's a model for each type of content. At the moment there's lots of duplication of code, but eventually the models will be simplified so that they inherit most stufffrom a standard model object.
