# Drivers

lol, what a grandiose name. Really I just mean the low level functions that handle disk-level file retrieval.

- `markdown.js` covers the CRUD operations around markdown files.
- `files.js` covers the CRUD operations around every other type of file. Which in this project is probably just images.
